# Inductive-Matrix-Completion
we proposed a type of inductive matrix completion with trace norm regularizer, and presented two practical method for solving trace norm based IMC optimization problem. Using two different tasks and four different benchmark tasks, We showed the max-norm can often be superior to established trace-norm regularization.
